# Path Issue Fix Instructions

## The Problem
The build path conflicts are caused by corrupted Kotlin compiler daemon caches that have mixed path references from our custom build directory experiments.

## Quick Fix (Recommended)

1. **Restart VS Code completely**
2. **Restart PowerShell**
3. **Run these commands in a fresh terminal:**

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --debug
```

## If Quick Fix Doesn't Work

### Option 1: Reset Development Environment
```bash
# Close VS Code
# Restart your computer
# Open fresh PowerShell and run:
flutter doctor
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --debug
```

### Option 2: Temporary Plugin Removal (Testing)
If you want to test which plugin is causing issues:

1. Comment out `location: ^8.0.1` in pubspec.yaml
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Try building
4. If successful, the issue is with the location plugin
5. Re-add the plugin and use alternative location packages if needed

### Option 3: Kotlin Daemon Reset (Advanced)
```bash
# Find and kill kotlin processes in Task Manager
# Or restart computer
```

## Root Cause
The custom build directory configuration we experimented with earlier created path conflicts in the Kotlin incremental compiler cache. Even after removing the custom configuration, the daemon cache retained conflicting path references.

## Prevention
- Use standard Flutter build directories (which we've now reverted to)
- Avoid custom build directory configurations unless absolutely necessary
- Always do `flutter clean` after changing build configurations

## Status
✅ API keys are secure
✅ Build configuration is now standard
⚠️ Need to clear corrupted Kotlin daemon cache (restart required)
